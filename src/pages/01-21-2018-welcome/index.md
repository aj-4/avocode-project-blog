### Welcome
Hi there, my name is Aaron and I'm a full stack software engineer. Recently I decided to build and deploy a scalable back end architecture with a group of engineers -- in these pages you'll find the triumphs and failures of this journey.

### Why might you be interested? 

Firstly, this will cover a comprehensive system design, execution and results from end-to-end. We will explore a multitude of technologies to accomplish this, all highly relevant at this current point in time (early 2018). 

- AWS EC2 and associated deployment strategies
- Using AWS SQS for asynchronous queue processing
- Docker image building and containerization
- Cassandra noSQL design and decentralized cluster scaling
- PostgreSQL, Redis, and creating read replicas
- A NodeJS analytics processing algorithm
- StatsD, Graphite, Grafana Metrics Tools

#### Enjoy
Should you endeavour to read on, I hope you find some great information and just enough entertainment to keep reading.
