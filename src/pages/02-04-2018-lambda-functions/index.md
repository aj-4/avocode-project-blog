### A Use Case for AWS Lambda
Serverless computing is (possibly) the future.

Well, in fact there are still servers, but they are abstracted away from the AWS user. Essentially instead of running a virtual machine server, one can now run code in a cloud-based execution environment.

Enter the Lambda function.

#### The Benefits
- Increase efficiency, reduce costs
Processors only fire when the function is active, therefore users can avoid idle EC2 instances running up the monthly bill.


#### Using AWS Lambda + SQS
