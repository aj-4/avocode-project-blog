### The Prime Objective
To build a scalable back-end simulation API infrastructure, which could lead to data insights for a large company.

### The ($1,000,000) Business Question
Does a host having 'superhost' status on airbnb affect their view/booking conversion rate on a day-to-day basis?

### Focal Points
=> Divide architecture into four distinct microservices (Bookings, listings, events, search/browse)

=> Dynamically generated large scale database and queries

=> Handle minimum 100 requests per minute, up to 10,000+

### Core Technologies
=> Amazon Web Services s2
=> Docker
=> Express
=> Cassandra

### Team Details
Four full-stack engineers whose back end expertise would be put to the test.
